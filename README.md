 ## Project Overview

This project aims to predict sales for Big Mart stores using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical sales data, the model helps identify key factors influencing revenue, enabling better decision-making for inventory management and store performance optimization.

 ## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformations.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding trends and patterns in sales data.

- Model Selection & Training: Implementing regression models, including XGBoost, XGBRFRegressor

- Evaluation Metrics: Measuring model accuracy using MAE and RÂ² scores.

 ## Tech Stack

 - Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Random Forest

- Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and visualization

## Dataset

The dataset contains historical sales data for various products across multiple Big Mart stores. It includes information such as product type, outlet size, visibility, and other key attributes affecting sales.
